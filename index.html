								<h2>About Me</h2>
							</header>

							<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/me.jpg" alt="" /></a>

							<p> . I have 11 years’ experience of lecturing Mathematics, Statistics, Operations Research and the Internet of Things (IoT) at the Belgium Campus. 
								This includes face-to-face, online and hybrid delivery. Giving class has enabled me to hone my presentation skills. I work independently in class deliverance 
								which is in English and as part of a team in the different subject clusters. I was tasked with designing an IoT course for the Belgium Campus 
								and its deliverance has been met with a lot of enthusiasm. My duties will include teaching between 8am to 5pm weekdays, marking all assignments and exams, 
								supervising student projects and reporting grades. I have also been appointed as cluster lead and my additional responsibilities include 
								implementing, monitoring, and assessing module improvements based on industry changes and feedback. 
								
								<br> My teaching philosophy is a mix between Progressivist, Behaviorist and Inquiry-Based philosophies. A blended teaching philosophy supports student development by balancing real-world relevance, structured growth, and inquiry-driven curiosity.
								I believe that education should empower students to become active, responsible citizens who think critically and engage deeply with the world around them. To achieve this, I embrace a teaching approach that combines structured guidance with opportunities for hands-on exploration and self-discovery.
<br> From a progressivist standpoint, I strive to create a learning environment where students feel valued, respected, and encouraged to bring their experiences into the classroom. I believe that education is most impactful when it addresses students’ holistic development, equipping them with skills that extend beyond academics and into their personal lives and communities. Therefore, I design lessons that connect to real-world issues, helping students see the relevance of their studies and inspiring them to become informed, proactive members of society.
At the same time, I recognize the importance of structure and clear expectations, drawing from behaviorist principles to reinforce positive learning habits and mastery of foundational knowledge. I use consistent feedback and reinforcement to encourage persistence and celebrate incremental progress, ensuring students build confidence and a solid academic foundation. By establishing a structured yet supportive environment, I help students develop the discipline needed to achieve both immediate academic success and long-term personal growth.
<br> Finally, I view inquiry as a powerful engine for student engagement and critical thinking. I encourage students to ask questions, investigate topics of interest, and actively engage in the learning process. Through inquiry-based activities, I aim to develop students' problem-solving abilities and cultivate a sense of curiosity that extends beyond the classroom. By guiding students through open-ended questions and collaborative projects, I help them become self-directed learners who are prepared to tackle complex challenges.
Overall, my teaching philosophy is rooted in a balanced approach that respects students' need for both structure and freedom, combining clear expectations with space for exploration and self-expression. I am committed to fostering a learning environment where students not only gain knowledge but also develop the character, curiosity, and commitment to become lifelong learners and impactful citizens.
